### Part I: Desperation

I'm Nathan, your **creator marketing partner**. I cut my teeth in ecommerce, _mainly for survival._

In 2020, I was a "classically trained code monkey." I hated it.

I went rogue with a few college friends and started our own ecom brand, JailBird, a party game about framing your friends for bird crimes.  
... and then instantly _went into crisis mode because of Covid._

We needed to run playtests, but people weren't allowed within 6 feet of each other. **Shoot.**  
I made organic content on YouTube and Instagram but saw no progress.  
I knew I needed to market, but _I was ignorant and had no idea how._

Someone told me that paid ads were the next big thing, so I started sinking money into paid media.

I wasted my first $300 on Facebook paid ads, with one sale.  
I wasted the next $300 on Amazon Ads, again with no sales.

One of my team members told me that we should run a giveaway on social media.

I had always been skeptical that social media really worked.  
Wasn't Instagram just a site for pretty pictures?  
Do likes and comments really translate to sales?

I was skeptical.  
**But I was even more desperate.**
