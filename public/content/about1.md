### Part I: Desperation

I'm Nathan, your **influence architect and marketing engineer**. I cut my teeth in ecommerce, _first for survival, then for fun._

In 2020, I was a "classically trained code monkey." I hated it.

I went rogue with a few of my college friends and started our own card game brand, JailBird, a party game about framing your friends for bird crimes.  
... and then instantly got _dropkicked by Covid._

We needed to run playtests, but people weren't allowed within 6 feet of each other. **Shoot.**  
I was making organic content on YouTube and Instagram but barely saw any progress.  
I knew I needed to market, but _I was ignorant and had no idea how._

Someone told me that paid ads were the next big thing, and I started looking into it.

I wasted my first $300 on Facebook paid ads, with one sale.  
I wasted the next $300 on Amazon Ads, again with no sales.

One of my team members told me that we should send some promotionals out and run a giveaway on social media.

I had always been skeptical that social media really worked.  
"Wasn't Instagram just a site for pretty pictures?"  
"Don't people just mindlessly scroll on the platform?"  
"Do likes and comments really translate to sales?"

I was skeptical.  
**But I was even more desperate.**
