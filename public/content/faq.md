# FAQ

##### For Brands and Creators

### 1. What is influencer marketing?

Influencer marketing is the greatest thing since canned bread.  

Imagine having a small army of passionate, raving customers telling their friends and family about your products.  

**Except, they have 100,000 friends each.**  

Every person has someone they look up to in their lives, someone who they like and trust. That trust goes a long way to giving them peace of mind that when they try a product, it'll be all they dreamed of and more.

Not only that, brands can shortcut years of building out their social media by partnering with creators who already know how to tell a story.

Nike had Michael Jordan.  
Skims had Kim Kardashian.  
Pepsi had Beyonc√©.  

**Who will you have represent you to the next generation?**

### 2. What sorts of influencer marketing services do you offer?

Hoshino Media runs managed campaigns, creator partnerships, talent management, and more. I created a 5-step process to make sure campaigns are a success for both creators and brands:  

1.  **Research:** We do a deep dive into campaign goals, KPIs, and expectations.  
2.  **Collaboration:** I tee up creators and let them know if the brand(s) have any pushback.  
3.  **Prep:** Meanwhile, I'm sourcing our pool of creators, giving them the brief. I'll then work with both creators and brands until D-Day to ensure all content is authentic while also aligning with brand goals.  
4.  **Execute:** We go into full alert 3 days before the campaign to make sure everything is checked and ready. When content launches, I work with every creator to make sure it meets all legal and alignment requirements.  
5.  **Retrospective:** After the campaign, I'll do a deep dive into wins and losses of the campaign, and make any adjustments necessary.

### 4. What kind of creators do you work with?

Hoshino Media works with creators on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok who tell stories about life, society, and love. I typically partner with creators with over 50k followers/subscribers, who tell stories to an engaged audience.  

If you consider yourself an entertainer or a curator (or both), you're exactly the type of creator I love working with.
