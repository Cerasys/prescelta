Here's what I've learned about influence in my 5 years of doing marketing:  
**We all have people in our life who have impact on our lives...**  
people we pay attention to, who hold weight in their opinions and emotions.

For some people, it's their mom or dad, or their friends.  
For some, it's the celebrity they see in the latest Marvel movie.  
And for many others, it's a person they see on the internet.

People call them _"para-social relationships"_, but I think that drastically misses the mark.

**"Influencer" is a broken term.**  
**People want human connections, which can only be told when you understand a person's story.**

We are all drawn to stories.  
And now, we live in a digital age where we can find amazing storytellers whenever we want.  
We can watch them on screens in our pockets as they grow, learn, fail, and laugh.  
We can celebrate their victories and lament their failures as we live our own lives.

**And these storytellers hold massive amounts of trust with their audiences.**

To all the brands and brand reps reading this, you need a storyteller as it will make or break your business.  
**Because people don't attach to products, they attach to people**

I started Hoshino Media to do just that. Based out of Seattle, we get to do amazing things now by partnering with the world's best storytellers, and I hope we get to work with you to share great tales about your company.

**And to all the storytellers reading this, keep telling yours.**
