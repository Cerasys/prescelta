Here's what I've learned about influence in my 5 years of doing marketing:  
**We all have people in our life who have impact on our lives...**  

These are people we pay attention to, whose opinions, emotions, or stories hold weight to us.

For some people, it's their family or their friends.  
For some, it's the celebrity they see in the latest Marvel movie.  
And for many others, it's a person they see on the internet.

People call them _"para-social relationships"_, but I think that drastically misses the mark.

**"Influencer" is a broken term.**  
**People want human connections, which can only be told when you understand a person's story.**

We are all drawn to stories.  
And now, we live in a digital age where we can find amazing storytellers whenever we want.  
We can watch them on screens in our pockets as they grow, learn, fail, and laugh.  
We can celebrate their victories and lament their failures as we live our own lives.

**And these storytellers hold massive amounts of trust with their audiences.**

It sounds cheesy and fake and virtual, but it's no different than reading a comic book about your favorite superhero or reading about heroes of history.  
In fact, it's more than that, because you get **see their wins, shortcomings, and humanity in real time.**

People (not consumers, but people!) are becoming increasingly disillusioned with big, faceless corporate.  
They seem them as no different from money-hungry entities bent on milking them dry.

**The brands that will survive the upcoming transformation of labor, AI, and technology will ironically be the brands that are the most human.**

So to all the brands and brand reps reading this, you need a storyteller as it will make or break your business.  
**Because people don't attach to products, they attach to people.**

I started Hoshino Media to do just that. Based out of Seattle, we get to do amazing things now by helping brands and startups partner with the world's best storytellers. 

**I hope we get to work with you to share great tales about your company.**
