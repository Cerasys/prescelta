### CPM Calculator

Want to figure out your rates? Most companies calculate the rate they pay you based on your **CPM (cost per 1000 impressions)**.

A typical CPM for creators is around $15-25 for US-based traffic. So, if you're getting 50k views and 50% of your audience is from the US, your campaign cost might be $500.

### YouTube Growth Tools: TubeBuddy

TubeBuddy is a YouTube extension that allows creators to quickly analyze keywords and tags for their videos and channel.

It's basically the **SEO tool of YouTube**. There's a free and paid version, so I highly recommend giving it a try.

_Use this to look at other videos similar channels are making and how well they're performing._

### YouTube Growth Tools: VidIQ

VidIQ is similar to TubeBuddy, but has a little more polish. It allows you to generate keywords and tags for your video.

They've also implemented some thumbnail generation features, but I'm not a huge fan.

_Use this tool to plan your keywords and different video ideas._
