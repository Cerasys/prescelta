### Part II: Progress?

      <figcaption>Yeah. We bought bird costumes.</figcaption>
</div>

We sent some products to some friends for them to post about and filmed some user testimonials.  
I thought it was a blatant waste of money and that we'd never recover.

The next day, Tori, my marketing officer, shot me a text.  
Tori: _“Yo Nate. We got two.”_  
Me: _“Two?”_  
Tori: _“Yeah, two sales.”_  
Me: _“Wait, what?”_  
Tori: _“Yeah. 60 people entered the giveaway. Two people bought directly.  
I'll start following up with the people who entered.”_  
Tori: _“...Nathan? Are you listening?”_

I hadn't even heard what she said.  
Two sales.  
**Progress.**

We kept making content, and I noticed that the more authentic smiles we captured (or rather, customers sent us), the more traction we would get.

**We didn't fake the shots.**

More accurately:  
**We couldn't fake the shots.**

We couldn't just take pictures or videos of anybody, it had to be our playtesters who were having fun _while playing the game_.

_This is known as UGC (user generated content), but at the time I was a marketing noob and knew nothing._

Soon, we were taking more preorders than we knew what to do with.

Long story short, **we went to a manufacturer that scammed us badly** 😭, and we needed something to make up the funds we lost and help deliver our pre-orders.

We turned to Kickstarter as our platform, and worked day and night to get the campaign online.  
We told a story of how we were birds on the run, because we were too busy
We worked with influencers like The Dice Tower (349k subs) and other local nano-influencers like PlayTest Northwest and Zulu Games.  
**We even got some shots with actual cops because they loved our story so much.**

**We raised [$9,628 from the Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jailbird/jailbird/) and an additional $2,343 on upsells after the fact.**  
**I'll never forget the feeling of $12,000 showing up overnight in my bank account and _I knew I had something._**

Not bad for a $20 game about bird crime.

I knew that I wanted to learn everything about these things that I had known so little about, and since then I've gone all in on marketing, influencers, and ads.

First I learned it just so the company could survive survive, then a couple of my friends started asking for help, and then I started doing work for other businesses.
