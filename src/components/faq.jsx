            <h3>1. What is influencer marketing?</h3>
            <p>
              Influencer marketing is the greatest thing since canned bread.
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine having a small army of passionate, raving customers teling
              their friends and family about your products.
              <br />
              <b>Except, they have 100,000 friends each.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Every person has someone they look up to in their lives, someone
              who they like and trust. <br /> That trust goes a long way to
              giving them peace of mind that when they try a product, it'll be
              all they dreamed of and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only that, brands can shortcut years of building out their
              social media by partnering with creators who already know how to
              tell a story.
