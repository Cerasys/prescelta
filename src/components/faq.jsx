            <h5>for brands and creators</h5>
            <h3>1. What is influencer marketing?</h3>
            <p>
              Influencer marketing is the greatest thing since canned bread.
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine having a small army of passionate, raving customers teling
              their friends and family about your products.
              <br />
              <b>Except, they have 100,000 friends each.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Every person has someone they look up to in their lives, someone
              who they like and trust. <br /> That trust goes a long way to
              giving them peace of mind that when they try a product, it'll be
              all they dreamed of and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only that, brands can shortcut years of building out their
              social media by partnering with creators who already know how to
              tell a story.

              2. What sorts of influencer marketing services do you offer?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Hoshino Media runs managed campaigns, creator partnerships, talent
              management, and more. I created a 5 step process to make sure
              campaigns are a success for both creators and brands:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Research: We do a deep dive of campaign goals, KPIs, and
                  expectations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Collaboration: I tee up creators and let them know if the
                  brand(s) have any pushback
                </li>
                <li>
                  Prep: Meanwhile, I'm sourcing our pool of creators, giving
                  them the brief. I'll then work with both creators and brands
                  until D-Day to ensure all content is authentic while also
                  aligning with brand goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Execute: We go into full alert 3 days before the campaign to
                  make sure everything is checked and ready. When content
                  launches, I work with every creator to make sure it meets all
                  legal and alignment requirements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Retrospective: After the campaign, I'll do a deep dive into
                  wins and losses of the campaign, and make any adjustments
                  necessary.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>3. What makes Hoshino Media different from XYZ agency?</h3>
            <p>
              <b>üíñ Creators are our soul üíñ</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Hoshino Media focuses on representing the best storytellers, but I
              don't just bring creators the big bucks and call it a day.
            </p>
            <p>
              <u>To my creator clients, we're in it for the long haul:</u>

            <br />
            <h3>4. What kind of creators do you work with?</h3>
            <p>
              Hoshino Media works with creators on YouTube, Instagram, and
              TikTok who tell stories about life, society, and love.
              <br /> I typically partner with creators with over 50k followers /
              subscribers, who tell stories to an engaged audience.
              <br />
              If you consider yourself an entertainer or a curator (or both),
              you're exactly the type of creator I love working with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our talent is diverse across gender, ethnicity and race,
              orientation, and even hair texture üíá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
            </p>

            <h3>5. How do you earn money, Nathan?</h3>
            <p>
              I earn 20% of all the deals I close, both inbound and outbound.{" "}
              <br />
              Ultimately, I want you to make money (lots of it), because that's
              how I make money (lots of it).
