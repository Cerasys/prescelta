                I'm Nathan, your{" "}
                <b>influence architect and marketing engineer</b>. I cut my
                teeth in ecommerce, <u>first for survival, then for fun.</u>
                <br />
                <br />
                In 2020, I was a code monkey that went rogue and started his own
                brand, and then instantly got <i>dropkicked by Covid.</i>
                <br />
                <br />
                I was making organic content but barely saw any progress.
                <br /> I knew I needed to market, but had no idea how.
                <br />
                <br />
                I wasted my first $300 on paid ads, with one sale.
                <br />I wasted the next $300, no sales.
                <br />
                We sent some products to some friends for them to post about and
                got some user testimonials. Two sales. <br />
                <b>Progress.</b>
                <br />
                <br />I kept cranking until from zero until I saw{" "}

                  $11,000 show up overnight in my bank account and
                  <i> I knew I had something.</i>
                </b>
                <br />
                <br />
                I've gone all in on marketing, influencers, and ads since then,
                first for me, then for my friends, and then for strangers
                brought to me by the universe.
                <br />
                <br />
                Influence is a funny thing.

                people we pay attention to, who hold weight in their opinions
                and emotions.
                <br />
                <br />I want to show you how Influencer Marketing is more than
                just a channel, <b>it's an engine for growth.</b>
