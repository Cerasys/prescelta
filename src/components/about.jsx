                I'm Nathan, your{" "}
                <b>sales process architect and marketing wizard</b>. I cut my
                teeth in ecommerce, <u>first for survival, then for fun.</u>

                In 2020, I started out and got <i>dropkicked by Covid.</i>
                <br />
                <br />
                I was making organic content but barely saw any progress.
                <br /> I knew I needed to market, but had no idea how.
                <br />
                <br />
                I wasted my first $300 on paid ads, with one sale.
                <br />I wasted the next $300, no sales.
                <br />
                We added on UGC and user testimonials. Two sales.{" "}
                <b>Progress.</b>

                <br />
                <br />
                I've gone all in on ads since then, first for me, then for my
                friends, and then for strangers brought to me by the universe.

                Influence is a funny thing.
